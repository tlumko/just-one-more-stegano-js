in-depth paragraph

faq  
- haven't heard any

roadmap  
- not linear pixel usage
- password
- encoding with lower impact (8-bit matrix rather than 16-bit)
- sudoku matrix key
- read/write text from/to file
- apply modifications to all unused pixels
- hide info different file format
- bmp
- recursive encoding
- browser client
- unicode support

it is not likely that any of this features would be ever done
